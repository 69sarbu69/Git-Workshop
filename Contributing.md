# Git Workshop Assignment Guidelines
The pull request should contain the following additions:

1. A new file named **username.txt** . For e.g, john-doe.txt. 
2. The newly created file should contain a short story of your choice along with your name and your Github username. 
3. A commit resolving a merge conflict. 

For #3, you will need to create a merge conflict on the newly created file. Please make sure you don’t change any other files. One way of preventing it would be to use `git status` before you add files to the staging area. Make sure that the only file modified is the new file you created. Also, **the commit message for the commit that resolves the conflict**, must explicitly begin with “Merge conflict resolved”. 

Consider the following when creating your PR: 
* The pull request should only modify your own file. 
* The pull request should not conflict with the main repository. 
* Your pull request can have as many commits as you want.
* The pull request must be sent to the main branch of the repository. 
* The pull request must contain only 1 additional file. 
* The pull request and commit message must be sensible.

The PR will be reviewed by our instructor and volunteers. After your pull request has been approved, you can view the effect of your changes at *link to hosted webpage* after which the assignment will be completed.
